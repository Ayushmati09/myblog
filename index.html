        <h2> cleanser: </h2>

       <h4><p>Cleansing is the first step of any good skincare routine. The type of cleanser you use matters more than you think it does — gentle face washes are the way to go, particularly if you plan on using more active ingredients down the line. "Too many people cleanse too much or too often or with a cleanser that's too harsh, and it will actually break down your skin barrier," warns Dr. Magovern.</p></h4>
       <hr>
       <h2> Toner: </h2>

        <h4><p> Toner is an optional step, but if you have a toner you like, you should absolutely use it. Dr. Magovern says that toner can be a great way to balance your skin's pH. If you have acne-prone skin, look for a toner with ingredients like salicylic acid to calm breakouts. If you have dry or sensitive skin, opt for a hydrating toner to soothe. </p></h4>
        <hr>
      <h2> Moisturizer: </h2>
      <center><img src="https://www.flaticon.com/svg/static/icons/svg/2748/2748106.svg" width="290" height="160"></center>
      <h4><p> After you've treated your skin, it's time to moisturize. Moisturizer keeps your skin hydrated and helps strengthen your skin barrier. For daytime use, opt for a lighter moisturizer that will soak in quickly and won't cause pilling under makeup. </p></h4>
      <hr>
       <h2> Sunscreen: </h2>

       	<h4><p>This is the most important step in your skincare routine. "If you don't wear sunscreen, it's like you might as well not do any of those other steps," says Dr. Magovern. "The sun is the number one reason why people's skin will age prematurely." Heads up: Protecting your skin from the sun is important even if you're spending your days indoors, as UV rays can still come in through the windows.</p></h4>
